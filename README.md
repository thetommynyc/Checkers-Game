# Checkers The Board Game

### A Game Worth The Click

#### Description

Welcome aboard fellow developers, after sifting through ideas I thought there is no better game to build then Checkers, with a sleek wooden board, chiseled pieces, and memories from my early childhood I had to recreate this one. This game will be created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript creating a functioning Checkers browser game that will include a player vs a computer, following traditional checkers game rules.If you'd like to contribute to the code I added a contribute section below, Enjoy!
  

#### As a user...

- I want to be able to have user play against a computer

- I want to be able to have who's ever turn it is to have their name highlighted 
 
- I want to be able to move all my pieces diagnolly forward and capture the other players pieces 

- I want to display caputured pieces on the left and right side of screen

- I want to be able to double jump as in real checkers

- I want to be able to be crowned when i reach the other players kings row

- If I have a piece that has been crowned I want to be able to move backwards and forwards acrosss the board

- I want to be able to display a quit/restart button, sometimes checkers can take hours so that would be a nice addition

- I want to be able to to add a custom picture to replace the piece for whoever gets their piece crowned 

- I want to have a rule book button so a user who hasn't played checkers before can be able to understand the game as well

- Lastly I would like to display a win, lose, or tie

#### Bonus Features

Extra features I would like to implement in the future include...

- a multiplayer option with face cam video so you can play and talk to people across the world

- a betting option in which you could connect real world funds to an online account and bet your checkers skills against other players

- a checkers skin pack to customize the board according to the players likeing, maybe a mid-evil board pack with fiery lava surrounding the board and having custom knights and trolls for checker pieces

#### Visualization and Design

- sleek elegant design with a weathered feel
- black background
- 8 x 8 gold/black board with a gold border surrounding it
- pieces traditional red and white discs with silver border to add some aesthetic
